                <p style="color:white;">Educating children is undoubtedly one of the most essential activities 
                  in the modern world, because today's children are tomorrow's future, and 
                  their development is critical for a brighter future. My goal is to help 
                  all nuero-diverse learners overcome obstacles and reduce their struggle 
                  during learning. I want to help children with Speech impairment, Visual 
                  perceptual/visual motor deficiency, dyslexia, intellectual impairments, 
                  learning disabilities, and other special needs feel mentally protected 
                  and empowered so that they can communicate and learn better.</p>

    <h1> About me</h1>
      <p class="intro">I am Dr. Anushkaa KS from grade 8 D of Euroschool North Campus. I have a 
        strong enthusiasm for mentoring, education, and learning. I sincerely
        believe that anybody can accomplish nearly anything with the perfect

        opportunity to do so! I want as many individuals as possible to

        <b>My personal story, that motivated me to create this website...</b>
          I have a very close friend who is a nuerodiverse learner, he is a bubbly
          child filled with a lot of energy. Everytime we have a conversation he pours 
          out all of his heart's thoughts and ideas! However I always faced slight difficulty
          understanding him. I upsets me when I think of how all his beautiful thoughts and 
          ideas may not be conveyed.</p>

  <div class="abtApp">
    <h1> About the website</h1>
      <p class="intro"><b>Enhancement of pronunciation:</b>
        Here you can say out loud the sound or name of the letter which will result in the
        display of that letter's cursive capital and lower case handwriting image. This way
        the children using this app can both improve their pronounciation and handwriting as
        they can see the letter of the sound that they are pronouncing and correct 
        themselves if wrong and also instantly view the written version of the word 
        in their head.
      <br>
        <b>Learning basic topics such as colors, shapes, number:</b>
          Here they can learn colors, shapes etc in a very visual manner increasing
          their practice in visual information proccessing. This aspect of my website aids 
          neurodiverse learners in strengthening their ability to interpret visual data as 
          they use the objects in their environment in integration with the website to learn 
          more effectively.They can show an object towards their webcam and see it's color, 
          name, shape etc.
          <br>
        <b> In addition </b>
          In the list at the end of te website, link to apps that aid in visual information
          proccessing in simple topics such as numbers, animals etc are present, clicking on 
          them will direct you to their respective screen. Apart from these apps, a website
          where the user can trace a cursive letter is present, this would definitely, greatly
          aid children who have trouble with handwriting.
